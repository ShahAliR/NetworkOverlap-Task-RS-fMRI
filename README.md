# Spatial Overlap Analysis: Resting-State Connectivity and Task-Evoked Activation

This repository contains the custom Python scripts for the spatial overlap analysis presented in the manuscript:
**"[Your Manuscript Title]"** (Preprint/Submitted to [Journal Name]).

This code quantifies the spatial correspondence between intrinsic functional connectivity (FC) maps derived from resting-state fMRI and task-evoked activation maps. The pipeline is applied to two distinct functional networks: a visuo-spatial memory network (rOTC seed & OLM task) and a language learning network (lvIFG seed & APPL task).
